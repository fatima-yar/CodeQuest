## Dev Academy Quiz Game Project

As part of our Friday Group Project at Dev Academy, our team of 5 created a quiz game aimed at helping junior developers learn and enjoy the process.

### My Contributions

I played key roles in the project:

- **Git Lead**: Managed version control and collaboration on GitHub.
- **Frontend Developer**: Designed and implemented the quiz interface.
- **Stylist**: Ensured the game's visual appeal and user experience.

### MVP Achievements

Our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) focused on:

- Designing a functional quiz with interactive buttons.

I successfully tackled challenges like creating the option buttons, which was particularly rewarding!

### Future Enhancements

Currently, I'm enhancing the project in my personal repository to achieve our stretch goals:

- Adding more quiz questions.
- Implementing a score counter feature.
- Introducing point deductions for incorrect answers.
