    <h2>Friday Group Project: Dev Academy Quiz Game</h2>
    =====================================
    <p>As part of our Friday Group Project at Dev Academy, our team of 5 set out to create a quiz game for junior developers to learn and have fun.</p>
    <h3>My Role</h3>
    --------------
    <p>I took on the role of Git Lead, frontend developer, and stylist.</p>
    <h3>MVP</h3>
    -----
    <p>Our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) was to design a quiz with interactive buttons. I'm proud to say that I successfully overcame the challenge of creating the option buttons, which was a tricky task for me!</p>
    <h3>Future Development</h3>
    -------------------
    <p>I'm currently updating our code in my personal repository to achieve our stretch goals, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Adding more questions to the quiz</li>
      <li>Implementing a score counter</li>
      <li>Deducting points for incorrect answers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Feel free to check out our project and watch it evolve! ðŸš€</p>
